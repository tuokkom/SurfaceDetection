# SurfaceDetection

Kaggle competition page https://www.kaggle.com/c/robotsurface/overview

School competition project for the course Pattern recognition and Machine learning. 

The goal was to predict the surface that a MIR robot is moving on. The sensor data of the robot was used in the prediction. 

I was part of a group 43 with three members. Our team was the 9th best out of 105 participant teams.
